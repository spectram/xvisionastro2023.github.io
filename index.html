            <h5>WELCOME TO XVISION-2023!</h5>

            <p class="lead">
                This Capacity Building Workshop aims to provide an unique platforms 
                for the students and yound researchers from developing nations 
                to learn the handling of X-ray data from the missions like XMM-Newton,
                NICER and NuSTAR. The teams of experts include a number of renowned 
                senior lectures from various fields. The hands-on sessions are supposed
                to be lead by the respective instrument team members.  
                
                This workshop is scheduled for Februry 06-17, 2023 and will be held at 
                North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa.

            <p> This workshop is the first kind where International Astronomical Union 
                (<a href="https://www.iau.org"> IAU</a>) and Committee on Space Research 
                (<a href="https://cosparhq.cnes.fr/">COSPAR</a>) are jointly supporting
                such an intiative for the capacity building in Astronomy. This workshop 
                is also supported generously by <a href="https://sagamma.org"> the South African Gamma-ray Astronomy Programme 
                (SA-GAMMA)</a> and<a hrfe="https://nwu.ac.za"> Center for Space Research, 
                North West University, Potchefstroom </a>, <a href="https://nasa.gov">NASA</a>
